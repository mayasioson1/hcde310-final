This file explains how my project changed from my project proposal.
I was originally planning to use the ProPublica API for my data, but it turned out to be very unstable and I was having a lot of trouble accessing the data. I decided to use the FEC's API instead since it has pretty much the same data (it's used by the ProPublica API) and a lot more of it. This worked really well for me.
I was also planning to use data about independent expenditures, but this data wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be and there wasn't that much of it for some candidates. Contributions reported by committees turned out to be a much more rich endpoint and I was able to get a lot more out of it.
Overall, I learned that some APIs are just unreliable and have nothing to do with your code not working, and you just have to find a way around that. I also learned that sometimes you don't really know what kind of data you'll get until you try to work with it.
